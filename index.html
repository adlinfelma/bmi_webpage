                <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
                <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered as a 'healthy weight'. Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days of week. </p>

            <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
            <p>Although BMI is often a healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.</p>

                <h6>Age</h6>
            </div>
            <p>In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat content.</p>

                <h6>Muscle</h6>
            </div>
            <p>BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.</p>
